The core functionality of this module was included directly into the [LootsheetNPC5e](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e)
with version 3.4.5.2 or later.

If needed for any non 5e system, feel free to create an issue. I will very likely help get changes from the lootsheet back to this module to get you started.

# Loot Populater NPC 5E

This module allows you to enable automatic population of loot on placed tokens in D&D5e.

The module was inspired by [LootSheetNPC5e](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e) and also is only really useful when using this in tandem.
LootSheetNPC5e adds the capability and permission handling for players to actually loot items from tokens/actors.

Also recommended is the use of [better rolltables](https://github.com/ultrakorne/better-rolltables), it will greatly improve you experience when working with rolltables.

### Features

Allows you to have automated random loot on NPCs when dropping them on the scene.
If installed and activated, it can make use of better rolltables.

Tables can be chosen from **World** and **Compendium**.

**Table priority when populating a token**

1. A actor has a rolltable assigned (via lootsheetNPC5e) this table will be used.
2. A ceature type specific table is found (but no actor specific table) - this table will be used
3. If a general default fallback table is set (nothing else)- this table will be used

**Tokens will not be populated when**

* Skiplist active and creature type checked in skiplist
