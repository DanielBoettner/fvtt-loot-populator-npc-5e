# Loot Populator NPC 5E

This module allows you to enable automatic population of loot on NPCs in 5e.

The module is heavily inspired by [LootSheetNPC5e](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e) and also is only really useful when using this in tandem. As LootSheetNPC5e adds the capability and permission handling for players to actually loot items from token/actors.
